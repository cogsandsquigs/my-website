Edit: originally, it was just link1 but because there is so much shit going on we're doing another links of the week. 

## 1. Somebody is doing something

Just thing it might be good to read this:

TL;DR: yes, people are actually doing things, and yes, we should be doing more, and yes, the democrats are actually doing their jobs (they don't have power right now, so they cant make any actual decisions or enact any laws --- remember the fucking election???).

Anyways, this just gives me a little (teeny-tiny sliver) of hope, that maybe we can turn this shipwreck of a country around.

## 2. Aaaand we're burning that hope to the ground now

What. The fuck. huh????

I guess democracy dies with a "nuh uh!"
