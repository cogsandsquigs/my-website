## 3. An outline of the "revolution"

[https://archive.ph/IY4O6](https://archive.ph/IY4O6)

These are both links to the same blogpost that outlines the "revolution" that's happening in the US government right now. Jesus.

NOTE: This is, obviously, a pro-trump pro-MAGA pro-fascist-revolution article. However, we cannot learn from ourselves, we must also learn from the enemy, and what they tell themselves. That is the only way we can stay strong.

Additionally, this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RpPTRcz1no) is very pertinent and good at explaining the above links.
