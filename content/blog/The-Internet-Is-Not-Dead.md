I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNLViWfCA0), which claimed that the internet is "dying" due to the mass influx of spambots and illegitimate accounts on mainstream popular social media. The entire video hinges on the fact that "the internet" is mostly just "social media" is mostly just corporate-owned mainstream applications. They liken the phenomenon to saying that the internet is a "dead mall".

To this I say: walk outside! You do not have to stay inside the dead mall. You can leave, anytime, anywhere.
