I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNLViWfCA0), which claimed that the internet is "dying" due to the mass influx of spambots and illegitimate accounts on mainstream popular social media. The entire video hinges on the fact that "the internet" is mostly just "social media" is mostly just corporate-owned mainstream applications. They liken the phenomenon to saying that the internet is a "dead mall".

To this I say: walk outside! You do not have to stay inside the dead mall. You can leave, anytime, anywhere. I know it's scary. I know that even as it's dead, dying, and slowly decaying, it's still where your friends meet up. I know that everyone is in the dead mall, and no one really cares to leave. You should do so anyways, at least for a while. Pop in and out, see what the world (the rest of the internet) has to offer. Establish your own house outside the mall --- isn't it odd how, you've existed in the mall for so long, that you even have your own little "home" inside it? But not your own home, that you own?
