I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gNLViWfCA0), which claimed that the internet is "dying" due to the mass influx of spambots and illegitimate accounts on mainstream popular social media. The entire video hinges on the fact that "the internet" is mostly just "social media" is mostly just corporate-owned mainstream applications. They liken the phenomenon to saying that the internet is a "dead mall".

To this I say: walk outside! You do not have to stay inside the dead mall. You can leave, anytime, anywhere. I know it's scary. I know that even as it's dead, dying, and slowly decaying, it's still where your friends meet up. I know that everyone is in the dead mall, and no one really cares to leave. You should do so anyways, at least for a while. Pop in and out, see what the world (the rest of the internet) has to offer. Establish your own house outside the mall --- isn't it odd how, you've existed in the mall for so long, that you even have your own little "home" inside it? But not your own home, that you own?

The video states that the old web was "killed off". That is not true! So long as there is at least one blogger, at least one indie journalist, at least one weird webpage, then the old web is still here (and there are [quite](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) [a](https://neocities.org/activity) [few](https://indieweb.org/) of those). It never died, it just de-mainstreamed.

Make your own blog, with [BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev/) or [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/) (if you are more familiar with HTML/CSS/JS). Buy a [cheap domain name](https://tld-list.com/) and make it your humble abode, a la [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). Use [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) (or discord/skype/whatever, if you wanna) to chat. Learn to use [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) as your alternative to the daily news (psst: mine is [right here](/rss.xml)!). Unlearn the cage that binds you, and re-learn how to use technology. I know it's hard. But it's even harder to keep going on with the bullshit that the internet seems to throw at you.

I know that this doesn't solve the problems presented in the video, at least not fully. There will always be spambots, always be hate. You may loose touch with a lot of friends and "friends". But we are human. We can be independent, caring, and connected. The internet was made for the little people, the independents, those wishing to seek freedom. To seek community. It was made for the nerds, the geeks, the weirdos, the oddballs. It was made for us.

Get out there. Establish your own home. Leave The Dead Mall.
